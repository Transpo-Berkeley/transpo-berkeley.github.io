# About the Site

Built using Jekyll and Tailwind, using [Forestry: Belkirk template](https://github.com/forestryio-templates/belkirk-jekyll-demo/).

Outdated CSS has been stripped and more configuration files have been added to make changing themes and sections of the website easier.

UC Berkeley/OCF requires sites on the x.berkeley.edu domains to be hosted by the OCF. Therefore, the site editing and Jekyll processing happens on GitHub, then an SSH process is initiated to pull the built files into the OCF host.
